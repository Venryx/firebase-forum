# Firebase Forum

Forum solution built using ReactJS, Redux, and Firebase.

Note: Library is not very modulized at this point; that is, it requires many specific libraries to already be in use in the parent project. Because of this, it's not yet recommended for use in third-party projects. Potential alternative: https://github.com/hoppula/refire-forum

### Install

```
npm install --save firebase-forum
```
